# Detection of pan-cancer surface protein biomarkers via a network-based approach on trascriptomics data

Cell-surface proteins have been used as diagnostic and prognostic markers in cancer research and as targets for the development of anticancer agents. It has been demonstrated that integrated network analysis on transcriptomic data is able to characterize specific subtypes of breast cancer (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34750607/). Such an approach has been implemented in a publicly available method called ‘SURFACER’ (https://github.com/N0toriou5/SURFACER). SURFACER implements a network-based analysis of transcriptomic data focusing on the overall activity of pathways located downstream of a curated list of human surface proteins. This approach has been widened to a pan-cancer dimension.
